1. The Unclad Github API

Using curl on the command line is a quick way to hit api enpoints.

Calling:
https://api.github.com

We get a JSON Response even thought we did not ask for anything specific.
We do net need to provide AUTH for this endpoint.
This endpoint is a map to all the other endpoints including query parameters.
That makes the github api a hypermedia api(Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and NodeCreating Evolvable Hypermedia Applications)

  "user_search_url": "https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}"
}

Accessing this info at the command line can be made simple by using jq a utility you can install with brew.
Notice that you must pass a dot to jq which means filter

Daniels-MacBook-Air:GithubAPI dan$ curl https://api.github.com | jq '.public_gists_url'
 **all the meta omitted**
 **the response**
""https://api.github.com/gists/public"


looking at how jq interacts with another endpoint  https://api.github.com/users/xrd/repos
